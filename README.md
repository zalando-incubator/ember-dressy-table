**Ember-dressy-table** is an [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) addon that includes a powerful component for creating frontends with complicated tablesâ€”i.e., involving filtering/sorting/pagination/etc. It aims to balance functionality and extensibility by providing these capabilities/features:

* a custom rendering component for table cells
* dynamic/rearrangeable/toggable columns
* the possibility to send actions from the cell component to upper components
* valid HTML
* easy i18n

You can use this addon out of the box. For the most common use cases, Ember-dressy-table requires only minimal development effort. However, it's open to extension for anyone seeking more sophisticated features.

### Why Ember-dressy-table

We created this addon after discovering that [DataTables](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables), while popular and mature, made implementing the custom renderer and actions from the cell component rather difficult when working with sophsticated tables. We looked for a mature "native Ember.js" component and found that the most popular option, [ember-light-table](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table), did not provide valid markup. 

[Ember-contextual-table](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-contextual-table), which is similar to Ember-dressy-table (and which directly inspired it), nearly required a full rebuild before we could create dressy columns. We wanted something for Ember.js that was like [Reactable](https://github.com/glittershark/reactable), which enables fast, flexible, and simple data tables in React.

#### User Testimonial: Zalando

We are using this addon in production at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/), an online fashion platform with +21 million active customers (i.e., at scale!) and it's doing the job.

### Core Technical Concepts

As noted by Robert Jackson in [this 2014 article](https://dockyard.com/blog/2014/06/24/introducing_ember_cli_addons), "distribution of reusable Ember.js libraries has been a pain point for quite a while. During application development we have frequently wished for a silver bullet for the sharing of concepts/code from one project to another." Ember-dressy-table aims to address Jackson's point by offering a solution.

Ember-dressy-table leverages the [open/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle), which reinforces that one should be able to extend the behavior of a given software entity without modifying its source code.
